# Work In Progress
## Stay Focused

Originally I planned to develope this addon for chromium browsers to learn the new hype word manifesto V3. 
Along the way I realized I needed this more than anyone so ported the original work to make it Firefox compatible
Please refer to [StayFocused-chromium](https://github.com/SecondMikasa/StayFocused-chromium) for original version

## Overview
Stay Focused is a minimalist yet powerful Pomodoro timer + Website Blocker built for productivity enthusiasts.

## Features I plan to or rather wish to add
- ~~Flexible Pomodoro Timer -> Lets you decide the session and break length~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~Sessions Number -> Number of session the timer will run before coming to a hault~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- ~~Block Site -> Lets you block the distracting websites while the timer is running~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Give users more controll over sessions eg. skip session, skip break etc. 
- A must needed feature to block mindless scrolling (Specifically for myself if anything)
- ~~Ability to control the block override timer (currently set to 1 min by default)~~ **IMPLEMENTED**
- Configurable notification sound and volume (uses the Windows default currently)

## Current Scenario
- Has the ability to start, stop and reset the timer 
- Notifications to inform for the starting and ending of sessions and breaks. Multiple sessions now supported
- Popup menu to select the session and break lenght 
- Website blocker is fully functional, but block override timer is not configurable
